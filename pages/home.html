                    Welcome to my Portfolio! I'm Clément Cadieux and on this site you'll see all about my interests,
                    past works and what I'm currently working on!
                </p>
                <p>
                    My main interest is computer science, most precisely programming. I'm proefficient in a
                    multitude of
                    languages and I am always trying to learn more. I pride myself on being quick to learn and quick
                    to
                    work. I also take the time to understand and master the core concepts of what I learn, so that I
                    can
                    always communicate my thoughts well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another interest of mine is sports! I mainly enjoy Hockey and Baseball, as they are the two
                    sports I
                    played (and still play) throughout my youth. I watch sports through an analytical lense, and my
                    main
                    enjoyment is derived through analyzing strategies and performances, often with the help of
                    statistics. Recently, I've also started to grow a passion for Soccer as it possesses that
                    strategic
                    and analytical aspect that I enjoy greatly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My third interest, and one that I look forward to working in, is teaching! Throughout my time in
                    school, especially learning computer science, I often found myself assisting and helping some of
                    my
                    classmate with schoolworks, especially in projects related to more complex back-end logic.
                    Through
                    this time, I've realised that I enjoyed teaching quite a lot and that I derive great pride out
                    of
                    seeign someone I helped make strides in both results and actual understading of materials that
                    they
                    would struggle with. My passion for teaching can be found right here on this website, as I have
                    dedicated my <a href="bootcamp.html">bootcamp</a> a page of it's own. While I have started
                    posting
                    some tutorial and guides on youtube about subjects that I enjoy, mainly object oriented
                    programing
                    basics, I plan to keep doing this during my free time and to post the results on my youtube
                    channel.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In terms of hobbies, I do quite enjoy video games. Again, like most aspect of my life, I usually
                    go
                    towards games that make me think analytically. My favorite game is Civilization VI, and I am
                    also
                    quite good at other games such as Factorio.
                </p>
                <p>On this website, you can see details about my projects, both personal and from school work. If
                    you
                    have any questions, or want to contact
                    me, you can find my information on the <a href="contact.html">contact</a> page.</p>
