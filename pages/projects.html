            or, if I think it is better suited, video demos of my applications. There will as well be links to the
            source code of all of these application, which will be found on github.</p>

                <h3>Baseball Stats</h3>
                <p>My first project that I want to show is called BaseballStats, a project I completed as part of my Web
                    Services and Distributed Computing class. This project was one of the many times I tried to combine
                    my interest in programming with my interest in sports. The details of the projects are explained in
                    the video demo</p>

                <h3>Black Jack</h3>
                <p>The second project is a black jack game I made as part of my game development course. This game, made
                    in unity, was to date my biggest experience in the game development world. As a team work, we had
                    split the tasks to our strentghs. I myself mianly focused on the mechanics of the game themselves,
                    such as implementing the rules, drawing cards and a betting system. More details in the video demo!

                <h3>Bootcamp</h3>
                <p>Lastly, of course, there is my object oriented programming bootcamp that I am working on in my spare
                    time. I'm not going to talk too much about it here, the details can be seen on the <a
