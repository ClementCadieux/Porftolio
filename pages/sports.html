                    Another interest of mine is sports! I mainly enjoy Hockey and Baseball, as they are the two
                    sports I
                    played (and still play) throughout my youth. I watch sports through an analytical lense, and my
                    main
                    enjoyment is derived through analyzing strategies and performances, often with the help of
                    statistics. Recently, I've also started to grow a passion for Soccer as it possesses that
                    strategic
                    and analytical aspect that I enjoy greatly.

                <p>
                    A project I have related to sports is BaseballStats, a project I completed as part of my Web
                    Services and Distributed Computing class. This project was one of the many times I tried to combine
                    my interest in programming with my interest in sports. It was my first experience with SpringBoot
                    and Docker.
