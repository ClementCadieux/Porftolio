                <p>
                    In terms of hobbies, I do quite enjoy video games. Again, like most aspect of my life, I usually
                    go
                    towards games that make me think analytically. My favorite game is Civilization VI, and I am
                    also
                    quite good at other games such as Factorio and enjoy roguelites in general. I also enjoy relaxing games, like Startdew Valley.

                <h3>Black Jack</h3>
                <p>The second project is a black jack game I made as part of my game development course. This game, made
                    in unity, was to date my biggest experience in the game development world. As a team work, we had
                    split the tasks to our strentghs. I myself mianly focused on the mechanics of the game themselves,
                    such as implementing the rules, drawing cards and a betting system. More details in the video demo!
